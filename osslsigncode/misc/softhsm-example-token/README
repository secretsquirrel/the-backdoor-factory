This directory contains a basic setup for testing pkcs11-support. If you get 
this to work you have a decent chance of using your real HSM or hardware token.

You need the following packages (ubuntu/debian names):

 - libengine-pkcs11-openssl
 - softhsm

Type 'make' to generate a softhsm token with a test-key on id a1b2 with PIN-code
"secret1". To use this token with osslsigncode try something like this (from this 
directory):

env SOFTHSM_CONF=`pwd`/softhsm.conf ../../osslsigncode sign \
   -pkcs11engine /usr/lib/engines/engine_pkcs11.so \
   -pkcs11module /usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm.so -key a1b2 -certs test.crt ...

Use 'secret1' as the password at the prompt.
